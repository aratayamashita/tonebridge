## What is ToneBridge?

tonebridge is an AI-powered translation tool that goes beyond word-for-word.  
It uses **Google Gemini** for translations and **ElevenLabs** for voices, showing you **casual, neutral, and professional** styles side-by-side.  

When ElevenLabs isnâ€™t available, ToneBridge falls back to standard **text-to-speech (TTS)** so you can still hear results out loud.

## Why itâ€™s different

- **Three tones at once** â†’ no need to pick blind, compare instantly  
- **Voice playback** â†’ ElevenLabs voices when available, fallback TTS otherwise  
- **Context-aware** â†’ meaning stays alive across styles

## About

tonebridge is built as an experiment in translation with personality.  
Words donâ€™t live in one style â€” and now, your translations donâ€™t have to either.
